Question 11

Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end it should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered.

Question 12

Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end the program should display the largest and smallest numbers entered.

Question 13

Write a program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500. If sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number.
For example, 153 = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 )

Question 14

Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user :
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 24 .....

Question 15

Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user.
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +…………1/n

Question 16

Compute the natural logarithm of 2, by adding up to n terms in the series
1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 -... 1/n
where n is a positive integer and input by user.

Question 17

Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.

Question 18

Write a program to print following :



i)

iv)

        *
      ***
    *****

v)

        1
      222
    33333
  4444444
555555555

vi)

        1
      212
    32123
  4321234
543212345



Question 19

Write a program to compute sinx for given x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. We compute the sine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up through the term involving xn

sin x = x - x3/3! + x5/5! - x7/7! + x9/9! .......

Question 20

Write a program to compute the cosine of x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. We compute the cosine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up through the term involving xn

cos x = 1 - x2/2! + x4/4! - x6/6! .....
