ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS
-means of discussing general efficiency of an algorithm

when discussing time complexity of algorithm, use
the positive integer n to represent the size of the data set it processes.
To evaluate the actual algorithm, we must ignore machine-dependent constants
(i.e., think about the number of instructions being executed, not about how
fast a certain machine can execute them) and look at its growth rate as n
approaches [infinity] (i.e., how does it grow as a function of time â€”
especially as n gets large?).

here are the terms you need to know:
1.  f(n) = Theta(g(n))
    f(n) is Theta of g(n) if and only if there exists some positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that
    c1 * g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 * g(n) whenever n > n0
    In short, f(n) is bounded both above and below by g(n) because after some point
