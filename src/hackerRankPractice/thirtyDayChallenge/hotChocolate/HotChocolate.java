/*

what if a method does not handle an exception?

method must declare it using "throws" keyword

if exception might arise...
1. use try-catch block
2. use keyword "throws" in method signature
    -states that we will handle error higher up in the program

we can also throw errors!
- we can throw error inside of method using "throw" when
  we know something is wrong with the program (even if Java
  does not know something is wrong)

for example: programming a game
rule 1: score should never be negative
rule 2: there should be no way to lose points
if we break rule, throw exception
stop invalid games via exceptions

java's exceptions only arise if there are...
1. syntax errors
2. logic errors/bad access errors
