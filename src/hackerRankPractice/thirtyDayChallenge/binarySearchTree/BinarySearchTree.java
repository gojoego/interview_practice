package hackerRankPractice.thirtyDayChallenge.binarySearchTree;

/*

more data structures: graphs and trees
-more terms
-recursive

when we draw tree, we draw a root
-node
-element of tree

trees
-root
    has two children
-leaves or children
-can add children to children
-the children are trees, sub-trees

1. node as child
2. subtree as child
3. no child

there are different ways of organizing data with a tree
what makes something a child vs a parent

heap
-root has special relations with children
-but children have no relationship with each other

1. min-heap:
    -smaller data
    -smallest element at root
    -everything below is bigger than root
    -root is smaller than children
    -does not mean 1 child smaller than other
    -order does not matter
    -as long as they are smaller than parent
    -example: golf

2. max-heap:
    =opposite of min heap
    -largest element at root
    -root is largest element
