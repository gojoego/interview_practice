what is inheritance?
-allows you to build new classes from existing classes
-reuse code
-defines the relationship between the superclass and the subclass

traits:
parent superclass = has the trait originally
child subclass = inherits the trait

* everything in code that is referenced inherits from object
* object is the superclass of things we create in java

object = superclass
animal = subclass
