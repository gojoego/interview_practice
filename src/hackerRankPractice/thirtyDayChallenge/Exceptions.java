STRING TO INTEGER
Many languages offer some functionality for parsing an integer value from a string token.

Each of these functions will raise an error (i.e.: throw an exception) when the argument
passed as the token parameter cannot be converted to an integer. Most languages have built-in
exception handling methods such as try-catch or begin-rescue that enable you to code
specific behaviors to handle execution issues.
