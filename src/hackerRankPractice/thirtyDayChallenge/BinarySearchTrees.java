BINARY TREE

-fundamentally, a binary tree is composed of nodes connected by edges
(with further restrictions discussed below)
-some binary tree, t, is either empty or consists of a single root element
with two distinct binary tree child elements known as the left subtree and the right subtree of t
-as the name binary suggests, a node in a binary tree has a maximum of 2 children

here are the basic facts and terms to know about binary trees:

1. convention for binary tree diagrams is that the root is at the top, and the subtrees branch down from it.
2. A node's left and right subtrees are referred to as children, and that node can be referred to as the parent of those subtrees.
