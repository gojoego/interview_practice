REMEMBER: Java is a strongly typed language.

Generics
-allow you to generalize what you put in your data structures (your containers of data)
-some data structures:
    linked lists- only one thing programmed to a certain type
-but we still want a consistent data type throughout the container
-allow a type or a method to operate on objects of various types while providing
compile time type safety
