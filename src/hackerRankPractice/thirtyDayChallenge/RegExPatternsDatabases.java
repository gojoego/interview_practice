Regular Expressions or RegEx
-means of describing a set of strings using a subset of common characteristics
-example: common characteristics of aaa, aba, aca are that they start and end with "a"
-regular expressions add level of abstraction to strings that makes it easier to search and manipulate text
-syntax standard across different programming languages

Character Classes
-not traditional class
-refers to set of one or more characters that can be used to match a single character from some input string
-basic forms:
    *   enclosed within square brackets
        specify what you would like your expression to match within square brackets
        for example: [a-f] will match any lowercase a through f character
    *   predefined: \ followed by a letter
        example: \d for matching digits (0-9) or \D for matching non-digits
        also additional predefined character classes that are followed by curly braces,
            such as \p{Punct} which matches punctuation
-key constructs
    "." the period will match any character; it does not have to be a letter
    "+" when appended to character or character class means one or more instances of previous character
